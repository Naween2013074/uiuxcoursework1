Its short-rental apartments are a common site for bachelor parties, rendezvous(es?), and other going ons. One gentleman fell from a balcony and died in 2006 after an especially dubious party there. Boxer Evander Holyfield also stayed here. Which is all to say, Global Towers is not a conventional hotel, nor is the Beach Club Bar (BCB) your conventional bar. It exists in a weird, transient space. Basically it feels like an Indian airport bar. Though the beach is across the train tracks, the BCB has no view. What you can see is a projector and TV. While we were there they were projecting and playing amazing Tamil karaoke songs and the TV was playing cricket. Which was pretty awesome. The place is dark and has a slightly dodgy feel to it, but everyone there is quite nice. </p>
